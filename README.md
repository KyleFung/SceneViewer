Scene Viewer<br>
A programming assignment for CS-184 (Foundations of computer graphics) on edX.com for rendering 3D scenes into a window as specified by an input text file. The user can view the scene while also moving the camera around by manipulating it with keyboard presses. Rendering done with OpenGL and windowing taken care of by GLUT. Some of the code, particularly the windowing code has been given by the course instructor. The GLSL shader in this code implements the Blinn-Phong model but the shader file can be reprogrammed for other visual effects.
